# Tensorflow Object Detection Project

This project implements a simple object detection model, finetuned on a small dataset to detect "ThumbUps", "ThumbDowns" and "LiveLong" signs.
All the steps can be found in details in the TFOD API Doc : https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
